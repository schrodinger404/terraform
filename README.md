# Terraform Overview

**Terraform** is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that enables you to define cloud and on-premises resources using human-readable configuration files. These files can be versioned, reused, and shared, making infrastructure management more efficient and scalable.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes. Several tools can help deploy IaC, which fall into two main categories:

1. **Configuration Management Tools**  
   _Examples_: Ansible, Chef, Puppet

2. **Infrastructure Orchestration Tools**  
   _Examples_: Terraform, ARM, CloudFormation

- **Official**: Owned and maintained by HashiCorp  
- **Partner**: Owned and maintained by third-party technology companies  
- **Community**: Owned and maintained by individuals
